## Intel速 IoT Developer Kit Cloud-based Analytics

> Intel provides a cloud-based analytics system for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) that includes resources for the collection and analysis of sensor data that the Intel速 IoT Developer Kit provides. Using this service, Intel Galileo/Edison device developers can jump-start data acquisition and analysis without having to invest in large-scale storage and processing capacity.

## Temboo

> Create, make, code the Internet of everything. Another API arbiter is called Temboo. This platform acts as a layer on top of third-party APIs, using code snippets to trigger complex processes that run through their cloud platform. Code snippets are added to your device code, perhaps on an Arduino Yun, and present a common methodology of function calls across a broad range of APIs. Code snippets are same format between different APIs. Temboo also tries to shield developers from having to maintain APIs on each device. If you know how to use Temboo for one application, you know how to use it for all.
